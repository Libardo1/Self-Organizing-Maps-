# Self-Organizing-Maps-

This model is used to predict the customers who have acquired credit cards from banks by providing fake information and data by using the concepts of SOM(self organizing maps).The objective is to develop a Deep learning model using both supervised and unsupervised learning to find out the irregularities of the fraudulent customers.

## Algorithm of the code
1) Importing the dataset
2) We do feature scaling for the given dataset
3) We train the SOM
4) We visuaulize the results of the fruad in SOMs
5) We find the fruadulant customers

## Running the Code
1) Obtain the Credit_Card_applications.csv file

2) Run the som.py file
